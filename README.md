PR0JECT TITLE

Investigate a Relational Database

DESCRIPTION

In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. 

Questions answered:

Which category of family movies has been rented the most/least?

For the Top 10 customers, which month was there the highest & least number of payments?

In which category and rental duration quartile was there the most & least number of family movies rented?

Which date saw the highest and lowest number of rentals?
